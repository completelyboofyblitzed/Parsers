0;It seemed like such a simple movie. The Naked Gun (1988) is slapstick comedy through-and-through, but I never would have guessed (h/t Steven O'Grady) how much detail and planning went into the jokes, especially the baseball scene at the end. There's lots of interesting behind-the-scenes info in Sporting News's breakdown of the movie. Even Drebin's bungled National Anthem performance was composed in advance for the scene:That's all from us for this week. Next week, I'm in Australia for the Melbourne R User Group and the eResearch Australiasia conference, so I expect blogging will be a little lighter than usual.

1;The Economist's Big Mac Index (also described on Wikipedia if you're not a subscriber) was created (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) as a measure to compare the purchasing power of money in different countries. Since Big Macs are available just about everywhere in the world, the price of a Big Mac in Sweden — expressed in US dollars — gives an American traveler a sense of how much more expensive things will be in Stockholm. And comparing the price of a Big Mac in several countries converted to a single baseline currency is a measure of how over-valued (or undervalued) those other currencies are compared to that baseline.Since its inception in 1986, the Big Mac Index has been compiled and calculated manually, twice a year. But starting with the most recent published index (July 2018, shown above), the index is now calculated with R. This is the first example of a new program at The Economist to publish the data and methods behind its journalism, and here the data and code behind the Big Mac Index have been published as a Github repository. The method behind the index is provided as a richly-commented Jupyter Notebook, where you can also find some additional charts and within-currency analyses not published in the main index.The repository is published under an open MIT license, meaning you can remix the code to create a new index on prices of another international commodity, provided you can find the data. Find everything you need at the Github repository linked below.Github (TheEconomist): Data and methodology for the Big Mac index;October 11, 2018;The Economist's Big Mac Index is calculated with R;http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/10/big-mac-index.html
2;I wasn't at the Use of R in Official Statistics (uRos2018) conference in the Netherlands last month, but I'm thankful to Jeroen Ooms for sharing the slides from his keynote presentation. In addition to being a postdoc staffer at ROpenSci, Jeroen maintains the official repository for the daily R builds on Windows — you might recognize his name from the verification certificate that pops up when installing R on Windows. His uRos2018 talk provides a fascinating glimpse into the complex systems, dependencies, and processes that come together to make installing R as easy as as double-click.On thing I found if interest is that while R is a complex program in its own right — made up of a mix of C (32%), Fortran (24%) and R (37%)  code — it also relies on a number of external libraries to perform some of its underlying tasks. For example:When you multiply two matrices or perform other linear algebra operations, R uses the BLAS and LAPACK libraries for the calculation. (Microsoft R open swaps in the Intel Math Kernel Library here, which provides the same calculations using different algorithms.)When you download a file with download.file or install.packages, R uses the libcurl library to manage the network transfer.When you use character data with foreign encodings (for example text with accents, symbols, and emojis), R uses the libicu library so those strings can be handled and compared in a uniform way.When you use regular expressions with grep and regexpr, R uses the PCRE library to parse the syntax and perform the search operation.For graphics, R uses the cairo library to render points, lines, and text as a bitmap image for display and/or export.Using these libraries means that the R maintainers don't need to reimplement the wheel, but can instead use open-source libraries that are used in a plethora of systems to accomplish these universal tasks. On Linux-based systems, these libraries are generally pre-installed for any application to use. But on Windows (and Mac), R needs to build these libraries for its own use, which makes building R a complex process. Not only do you have to have the right set of compilers and scripts to build R itself, but also all its library dependencies as well. R packages may, in turn, depend on other third-party libraries and in that case the same issues apply to building them, too.You can find all of the scripts used to create the official releases and daily builds (r-patched and r-devel) for R for Windows on Github. Brian Ripley and Duncan Murdoch (and now, Jeroen Ooms) have long provided RTools: a collection of Windows programs (shell commands, other programs) which, given the right compiler, will allow R's build scripts to run. One other interesting bit of news from Jeroen's keynote is that an experimental version of RTools is on the way, which promises to make it easier to build, distribute and install external libraries on Windows.If you're at all interested in the inner workings of what it takes to make R run on Windows, I recommend checking out Jeroen's talk at the link below.Jeroen Ooms: The R infrastructure;October 09, 2018;How R gets built on Windows;http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/10/how-r-gets-built-on-windows.html
3;Since 2015, the R Consortium has funded projects of benefit to, and proposed by, the R community. Twice a year, the R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee reviews grant proposals and makes awards based on merit and funds available. (Those funds come, in turn, from the annual dues paid by R Consortium members.) If you'd like to propose a project of your own, the deadline for submission for the Fall 2018 Call for Proposals is October 31.Not sure what kind of project might be approved? In general, the R Consortium grants fund projects in these categories:Creation of general infrastructure supporting R, like the R-hub project which provides build services for R package developers on every platform supported by R.Development of new R packages, like DBI for R which provides a general interface between R and databases. Support for working groups to meet, discuss and plan new initiatives in the R community, like Certification for R developers.R community programs, like R Ladies.A good way to get a sense of suitable projects is by browsing the list of previously-funded R Consortium projects, or by taking a look at the regular project reviews in the R Consortium blog, like this update posted earlier today.And if you're not sure how to put a proposal together, Steph Locke has created a boilerplate R Consortium proposal as an R Markdown document you can clone from Github, along with a detailed set of instructions on how to complete it for your project idea.So, what ideas do you have to make the R ecosystem better? A new package? A new working group? A new community initiative? If you need financial support to make that idea a reality, consider applying for an R Consortium project grant.

4;"Thanks to Mike Loukides I recently discovered IDEA, a series of algorithm explainers presented as IKEA assembly instructions. It's a brilliant concept: IKEA instructions have to be clear and easy to follow, in sequential steps, without use of language. There are entries for determining a convex hull and for various sorting algorithms, but this one on public key encryption is my favorite (not least because it's the first time I feel like I ""get"" the concept).Credit: idea-instructions.com.

The EARL roadshow continues with a stop in Texas.Nov 13: EARL Boston (Boston, MA). The EARL roadshow concludes with a 1-day event in Boston.Dec 8: SatRDays DC (Washington, DC). Talk proposals for this Washington, DC instance of SatRDays are open until October 31.Jan 15-18 2019: RStudio::conf (Austin, TX). The annual conference from the makers of RStudio takes place in  Austin, Texas.I go to a lot of conferences these days, but those organized by the R community remain my favorite. Attending one of these events is a great way to learn new R skills, but equally importantly to meet other R users from a different disciplines, and perhaps discover that their problems and applications aren't that dissimilar from your own. I'll be at many of the events listed above, and I look forward to meeting you all there.If you can't find an event at the right time or place for you, take a look at the index linked below for a list of upcoming meetups, conferences and events from the R community.

7;"Microsoft Ignite, Microsoft's annual developer conference, wrapped up last week and many of the big announcements focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. The keynote presentation from Microsoft's Cloud AI lead Eric Boyd showcases the major developments, or you can check out his accompanying blog post for a written summary. In this post, I'll dive down into the details of the specific announcements and provide links to the associated recorded presentations from Ignite and other technical documents.Tools for AI developersAzure Machine Learning Service (Azure ML) adds several new capabilities. These include a new Python package that developers can use to prepare data for analysis, automate machine learning and deep learning model training, track model performance under various conditions, and automate the model selection process (see below). It supports a variety of execution environments, from local desktops to GPU clusters, and deploy trained models with containers or even high-performance FPGA chips.  (The desktop ""Workbench"" client, previously in preview, is no longer required and has been deprecated.) Watch the Ignite presentation AI with Azure Machine Learning services: Simplifying the data science process for an overview and demo.Automated Machine Learning, a new Azure ML service in preview, automates the selection of machine learning algorithms (and associated parameters and hyperparameters) to optimize predictive performance. This blog post provides the technical details, and another blog post describes some practical applications. A Microsoft Research paper describes the probabilistic matrix factorization technique behind the optimization. This Ignite presentation provides further details and includes a demo.  Visual Studio Code Tools for AI has been updated to provide a convenient interface to Azure ML for users of the popular open-source editor.SQL Server 2019 is now in public preview, with many improvements shown in this Ignite keynote. Updates include Spark support, and added Linux support for in-database R and Python (watch this Ignite presentation for details).Azure Databricks is now supported in more regions, offers GPU support for deep learning, and Databricks Delta is now available (in preview) for transactional data capabilities.Customized AIMicrosoft Bot Framework SDK v4 is now available. The Ignite presentation ""Creating Enterprise-Scale Intelligent Agents and Bots"" provides an overview and several examples.Cortana Skills Kit for Enterprise, a development platform based on Azure Bot Service and Language Understanding is now in private preview.  Pre-trained AISpeech Service in Azure Cognitive Services is now generally available, and includes a new neural text-to-speech capability for humanlike synthesized speech.

8;I was about the same age as student pilot Maggie Taraska when I had my first solo flight. Unlike Maggie, I didn't have to deal with a busy airspace, or air traffic control, or engines (I was in a glider), or — most significantly — one of my landing wheels falling off during the flight. But Maggie handled the entire situation much more coolly than I remember my own short, uneventual, first solo. Just listen to the radio chatter below. If you're in a rush, you can skip the period from 2:00 – 7:30 while she circles the Beverly (MA) airport waiting for a couple of other planes to land first, but the whole thing is worth a listen to hear how she successfully lands with only one wheel on the left side. That's all from us at the blog for this week.

9;"During the EARL (Enterprise Applications of the R Language) conference in London last week, the organizers asked me how I thought the conference had changed over the years. (This is the conference's fifth year, and I'd been to each one.) My response was that it reflected the increasing maturity of R in the enterprise. The early years featured many presentations that were about using R in research and the challenges (both technical and procedural) for integrating that research into the day-to-day processes of the business. This year though, just about every presentation was about R in production, as a mainstream part of the operational infrastructure for analytics. That theme began in earnest with Garret Grolemund's keynote presentation on the consequences of scientific research that can't be replicated independently. (This slide, based on this 2016 JAMA paper was an eye-opener for me.) The R language has been at the forefront of providing the necessary tools and infrastructure to remove barriers to reproducible research in science, and the RMarkdown package and its streamlined integration in RStudio, is particularly helpful. Garret's keynote was recorded but the video isn't yet available; when it's published I highly recommend taking the time to watch this excellent speech.The rest of the program was jam-packed with a variety of applications of R in industry as well. I couldn't see them all (it was a three-track conference), but every one I attended demonstrated mature, production-scale applications of R to solve difficult business problems with data. Here are just a few examples:Rainmakers, a market research firm, uses R to estimate the potential market for new products. They make use of the officer package to automate the generation of Powerpoint reports.Geolytix uses R to help companies choose locations for new stores that maximize profitability while reducing the risk of cannibalizing sales from other nearby locations. They use SQL Server ML Services to deploy these models to their clients.Dyson uses R (and the prophet package) to forecast the expected sales of new models of vacuum cleaners, hand dryers, and other products, so that the manufacturing plants can ramp up (or down) production as needed.Google uses R to design and analyze the results of customer surveys, to make the best decisions of which product features to invest in next.N Brown Group, a fashion retailer, uses R to analyze online product reviews from customers.Marks and Spencer uses R to increase revenues by optimizing the products shown and featured in the online store.  PartnerRe, the reinsurance firm, has built an analytics team around R, and uses Shiny to deploy R-based applications throughout the company.Amazon Web Services uses containerized applications with R to identify customers who need additional onboarding assistance or who may be dissatisfied, and to detect fraud.Microsoft uses R and Spark (via sparklyr in HDInsight) to support marketing efforts for Xbox, Windows and Surface with propensity modeling, to identify who is most likely to respond to an offer.
